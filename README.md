# Getting Started with the iTwin Viewer Create React App Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Environment Variables

Prior to running the app, you will need to add OIDC client configuration to the variables in the .env file:

```
# ---- Authorization Client Settings ----
IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=""
IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URI=""
IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_LOGOUT_URI=""
IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_SCOPES =""
```

```
# ---- Test ids ----
IMJS_ITWIN_ID = ""
IMJS_IMODEL_ID = ""
```

After filling the above fields in the .env file, you can simply run the application.
